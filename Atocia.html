        <p>
            The story of the church of our Lady of Atocia dates to the Great Siege of 1565 where several buildings were destroyed in Birgu, 
            leading to many deaths. Along with the houses that were destroyed, was the house of Toni Spinaci. In the house that was knocked 
            down, he had a baby girl named Elizabeth, who was sleeping in her cot, and was trapped under the rubble of the destroyed house. 
            Her parents thought she had died but, by some miracle, she was found alive. From this incident, God continued to protect her as 
            He needed her to spread adoration and devotion towards our
            Lady of Atocia. <!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
            
            <br><br>
            
            This devotion was brought to Malta by businessman Guzepppi Casauri who was married to Elizabeth Spinaci while he was on business 
            in Toledo who, inspired by the devotion he shared for the miraculous icon of Atocia, managed to obtain a copy of it from a friend 
            of his. When Casauri returned to Malta he built a church, with some rooms attached to it. This church was built on another church 
            which was in ruins and dedicated to St. Nicholas, on a hill previously known Braxia Hill.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            From then on, this hill started being referred to as Atocia Hill, while the church is known as ‘tas-Samra’ due to the dark skin 
            complexion of Holy Mary’s face, which is identical to the one found in Madrid. Suddenly, several graces were granted thanks to the 
            intercession of this miraculous icon, and many were those who began to visit the church and pray in front the devoted icon.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            In the beginning of the 20th Century, this church was abandoned and eventually was closed. It was opened only once a year for 
            the feast of the Assumption of St. Mary while, during the rest of the year, was reserved for storing of fodder, hay, and straw.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            The devotion for the feast of St. Mary on the 15th of August was started by St. Ġorġ Preca and continued by Priest Ġorġ Bonello, 
            a feast which is still celebrated with great enthusiasm to this day.
