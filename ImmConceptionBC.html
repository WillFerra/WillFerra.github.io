        <p>
            The Immaculate Conception Band Club was founded in the year 1978 when a certain Tony Borg and some of his friends decided to start 
            working towards establishing a new musical society in Hamrun. The need for a new musical society was rapidly increasing when a new 
            parish in Hamrun was founded and the population in the area was 
            increasing. <!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Tony Borg’s vision became a reality a year later, when on the 22nd of August of the year 1979, the first general meeting of the new 
            society was held in the Victoria United Football Club in Barth Street. With time, the meeting place changed multiple times. From the 
            Victoria United Football Club, they moved to a garage in ‘Kanonku Bonnici’ Street, after which they moved to another place in Guze 
            Pace Street and in Villambrosa Street until a house in the more central ‘Kappillan Mifsud’ Street was bought. On the 1st of August 
            2002, the club moved again to a house in ‘Kappillan Muscat’ Square, a few metres away from the parish church. This new club was 
            officially opened on the 29th of August 2004 from the then President of the Republic of Malta Guido de Marco.

            The first band conductor of the newly founded club was Alfonse Maria Vella. The club went through many changes to keep growing and 
            improving. In 1993, during a general meeting, it was decided to change the colour associated with the club. The colour was changed 
            from yellow to light blue. During this meeting, the Nome di Maria emblem in the centre of the club flag was also changed.

            The club’s band gave many performances since it was founded. Some of these include performances in the feasts of Bidnija, Dingli, 
            St. Venera and Marsaxloxx. The band participated in the visit of Pope St. John Paul II. It also took part and played during the Small 
            Nations Games, during a celebration after Hamrun Spartans won the football tournament and many other activities held in Hamrun along 
            the years. The band also played during Carnival, the opening of the Serenity Ward in St. Vincent de Paul and was also invited to play 
            during celebrations held in the century of the other Hamrun Band Clubs, that of St. Joseph, in 1989 and St. Cajetan, in 2006.</span>
