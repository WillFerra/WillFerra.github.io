        <h2>Saint Cajetan Band Club</h2> 

        <!-- Adding the body -->
        <p>
          The St. Cajetan Band Club was founded in 1906 when some band members that played with the St. Joseph’s Band (1889) decided to not 
          attend for a concert that band was going to do during the feast in Floriana. After this, these members were brought before the 
          band’s committee and asked to give a reason for their 
          behaviour. <!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
          
          <br><br>
          
          The committee decided that the excuse brought from the members was not a valid one and as punishment they decided to remove him from 
          the club. Some other members thought that this was not just and decided to join him in founding a new club and competitor. They 
          founded the new band club on the 24th of June 1906, Feast of St. John the Baptist and named their new club after the patron saint 
          of Hamrun, St. Cajetan.
          
          <br> <br>
          
          Francesco Buttigieg was the mind behind the new club and is considered to be the founder. Immediately, Buttigieg and his friends 
          started looking for a new place from where the club could function. They found a small dwelling in St. Joseph’s High Road, numbered 
          707. Later, from there the club moved to 699 in the same street, after which they moved to another place, where today once can find the 
          LEGA. Finally, the club moved to its current location, Palazzo Thiene in St. Joseph High Road, a few meters away from the parish church.
          
          <br> <br>

          The St. Cajetan Band performed for the first time during the feast of St. Cajetan on the 6th and 7th of August 1906, exactly 44 days 
          after its foundation. The club was given the nickname ‘Tat-Tamal’ (dates). This nickname came from the supporters of the other band 
          club who started calling their rivals this because next door to the club’s sede was a small shop that baked and sold dates.

          <br> <br>

          The main aim of the club was to cultivate a culture of music amongst the locals, this encouraged members to start a music school in the 
          late eighties. This school is still open to this day. Anyone can go and start learning music, the club even offers its learners a free 
          instrument when learning. The club is the proud owner of a beautiful collection of music, from marches, funeral marches, classical 
          pieces and more, the club has a variety of music scores in its archives. Undoubtedly, some of the most valuable music the club owns 
          are the ones that were written by its conductors. One can mention the Clubs Hymn, a beautiful composition of Mro. Joseph Abela Scolaro 
          with the lyrics written by Fr Frans Camilleri.
          
          <br> <br>

          One of the hardest working sub-committees of the club is the youth committee. Founded in 1987, the youth committee was always one the 
          club valued the most. Youths within the club work voluntarily to help the club function, prosper and grow, organising fund-raising 
          activities to help sustain the club.</span>
