        <p>
            When Hamrun was still a small hamlet of about 4000 people, the culture of music of the late 19th century started to become more prominent 
            amongst the people. Giuseppe Mintoff and some of his friends were at the front to bring this new culture in their community. Mintoff 
            encouraged his friends to take a course in music so they could start a big band together. After only a few weeks, the people learning 
            music started to grow until it reached around 30 people. <!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Every beginning has its difficulties, and the new band club had its own. However, despite all the difficulties they faced, Mintoff and 
            his friends were determined to form a new club, the first of its kind in Hamrun. Joined by music conductor Carmelo Doneo, they were 
            successful and on the 18th of August 1889 they founded the Saint Joseph Philharmonic Society. Sir Temi Conti was appointed as the first 
            president of the new club.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            The new club took the name’s sake of Saint Joseph, even though the patron saint of the parish (formed in 1881, 8 years prior) was Saint 
            Cajetan. Some of the reasons for this name are:

            <br><br>

            1.	The town was still named ‘Casale San Giuseppe’ and not Hamrun yet<br>
            2.	The club was opened on Saint Joseph’s High Road, the main street of the town<br>
            3.	Most of the members were named after St. Joseph and the town itself<br>
            4.	The primary school of the area was named ‘Scuola Primaria di San Giuseppe e Samra’<br>
            5.	Sculptor Vincenzo Dimech had donated a stone statue of St. Joseph to the club prior to its opening<br>
            6.	At the time, the locals where more devoted to St. Joseph rather than St. Cajetan<br>
            7.	It was tradition at the time that no band was named after a Saint in that parish
            
            <br> <br>

            The band played for the first time during the feast of Saint Cajetan, on the 6th of August 1892. The band under the direction of conductor 
            Doneo, wowed the audience present with how much the band had improved during such a short period of time.

            <br> <br>

            The current sede of the club is located in the very prominent centre of Hamrun, right in front of the Parish Church. The original sede 
            was located in St. Cajetan Street. Later it was moved to 233 St. Joseph Street. After they moved a few doors up the road corner with St.
            Mary Street. The club didn’t stay in this property for too long. It soon moved into a house in St. Cajetan Street to be closer to the 
            church. However, at the time, this street was quite secluded. When the members decided to move again, they found a house next to the 
            church (today the Civic Club) however it was missing quite some of the necessities the club required. Finally, they managed to obtain a 
            house in front of the church, exactly where they are today.
            
            <br> <br>

            The club is commonly known by its nickname ‘Tal-Miskina’ (of the disadvantaged). This nickname was given to the club by the supporters of 
            its rival club, St. Cajetan Band Club. The nickname came from the fact that many of the band supporters had left the club to form a new 
            club.
        
            The youth committee of the club was founded on the 1st of November 1985, the first of its kind in Malta. Today more than ever, this 
            committee takes on work to help the club in any way possible especially during the feast of St. Cajetan.</span>
